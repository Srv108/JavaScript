Write three dummy functions using only promises and only using normal callbacks, All three functions 
are dummy, you dont need actual implementation. These dummy functions are to just represent a delay.

1.  Write a function to download data from a url

2.  Write a function to save that downloaded data in a file and return the filename

3.  Write a function to upload the file written in previous step to a newurl

4.  THe download should take say 4sec delay, filewrite should take 2sec delay, upload should take 3sec delay

5.  Write the above callbacks and use them in a manner that first download happens then writefile happens 
and then upload happens
